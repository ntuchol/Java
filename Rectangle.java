/*
 * Rectangle.java
 * 
 * Computer Science 111, Boston University
 * 
 * A rudimentary initial version of a class for Rectangle objects.
 * These objects simply group together four variables.
 * 
 * Given this version of the class, our client program 
 * has to do most of the work itself.
 * 
 * In the lecture notes, we gradually add features to this class that
 * simplify the client program and provide encapsulation.  
 * 
 * See the rectangle_final directory for the final version of the class.
